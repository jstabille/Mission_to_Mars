# Mission to Mars

## Overview

The objective of this Challenge is scrape data from various websites to create an new webpage that highlights facts about the planet Mars. Splinter and Beautiful soup libraries were used to scrape the relevant data. From there, I transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to my webpage using flask. Lastly, I used bootstrap to cleanup my webpage to make it presentable.

Here is a screenshot of the polished webpage.
